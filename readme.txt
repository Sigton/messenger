before using Woodpecker if python is not installed please go back a folder and open the installer called "python-3.6.4"
after running this make sure to disable , install for all users and inside the installation folder section paste in "\\H023FILESRV01\OldPupilSHare\slamjam\python36"
once installed you should be able to run the main.py file and select "Python" as the program used to run it.

These instructions are only required if an exe version is not available.
If there is an exe, use that.
